# California Classics GARAGE visit card
>`PROJECT 2` for Googles Udacity Android Developement Course

This is the second app made for Googles Android Development Scholarship. In this project I was asked to create a visit card for a company of my choice that includes description, contact details and at least one picture. I chose a non existing company called California Classics GARAGE that fixes classic cars.
----------------------------
The card is set to adjust the contents to distribute them properly on various sizes of screens. Main areas of the app - picture, description and contact details are distributed vertically using weights to achieve 5:2:3 proportions. Each contact detail is placed in one of four "bullet" like containers that expand to fill the available area. I also decided to make a separate layout for landscape orientation so I can arrange elements on the screen more efficiently in that mode. Contact detail "bullets" are shown in a 2x2 grid instead of a vertical column and a wide version of the main picture was used to cover the additional width.
